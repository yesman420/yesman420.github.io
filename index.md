* Lab 7
    This was one of my favorite labs because I love playing card games like blackjack in my spare time, and being able to code how cards are dealt made the lab really fun.
* Lab 11
    I liked lab 11 a lot, it wasn't my favorite though. I enjoyed coding about the different US states and the difference in population. Though I failed the lab a couple times I think I learned the most from this one!
* Lab 9
    This was my favorite lab for many reasons, my group members were funny, and we worked great as a team. Another reason is that I enjoyed coding the secret number game, even though it felt easier than some of the other labs.
